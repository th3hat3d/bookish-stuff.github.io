Just some nerdy kid from the States. A budding opportunist, I take any opportunity that comes my way. As a lifelong learner, I strive to explore the literary world as I desire and anything else I'm interested in. Speaking of which, here's a list of some interests of mine, if you would like to know:
- Mathematics
- Tech
- Networking
- Books (ofc)
- Chess
- Music (Dubstep and EDM especially)
- Anything nerdy!

This blog was made as a way for me to write about my bookish hobby and being a bookworm, and share it with other readers and whoever else happens to be interested. Put simply, it's my personal literary outlet. Enjoy your time here.
